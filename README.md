# ESP8266 MiLight Hub PCB

This project contains Gerber files for a PCB designed for [ESP8266 MiLight Hub](https://github.com/sidoh/esp8266_milight_hub).
I don't have a lot experience with github, this is why sidoh (the developer of the milight hub) uploaded the Gerber files at his page. I forked this learn a bit more about github. Also it's nice to have my first repository here.
